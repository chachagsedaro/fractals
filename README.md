Are you wondering where my profile picture comes from? If so, you're in the right repository. I used basic machine learning to creatively edit any photo.
You can try your own photo by replacing the "Face.png" in my code with the name of your photo. I've also saved the original photo for my experiments in this repo itself.

Have fun :)
